# Email/Username OSINT

Corporate usernames can be obnoxiously easy to guess and build. The standard of FIRSTNAME.LASTNAME@CORP.com is so common, it's ridiculous. Even more so when account management tools will simply take the first half of the email and reuse it as a username. We can use schemes like this to our advantage to search for a multitude of treasures like accounts on other services with the same username, credentials found in breaches, and associated sites or tools. When searching for usernames, you can uncover linked social media accounts and tons of relevant intelligence.
