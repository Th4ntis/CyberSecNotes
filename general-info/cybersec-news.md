# CyberSec News

Keeping up with various Cyber/Information Security can be done through various Social media, such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/), [Reddit](https://reddit.com), or RSS Feeds. With some of the platforms dying or just going down hill, I wanted to show places of ways to get updates in the Cyber/Information Security world.

There is also Mastodon, I myself am on [infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange), and [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/). Though Mastodon isn't always the easiest to Navigate and BlueSky has a relatively small user base at the moment.

## Reddit

[Reddit](https://reddit.com) works, it just depends on which Subreddit you follow, since anyone can make a post at any time so it can be flooded with people asking questions or nonsense. So it depends  n the moderators or bots to kind of keep things cleaned up. Some of the various subreddits I follow are:

* [r/CyberSecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/)
* [r/Privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/)
* [r/PrivacyGuides](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivacyGuides/)
* [r/OpSec](https://www.reddit.com/r/opsec/)

Though there are plenty of others, there's a subreddit for just about anything/everything.

## Twitter

[Twitter](https://twitter.com) is where a large things are posted often and first, but as of recently it's been on a down slope and more so after various rumors of it being you need to pay to use it. People and groups I follow include:

* [@vxunderground](https://twitter.com/vxunderground)
* [@packet\_storm](https://twitter.com/packet\_storm)
* [@DailtOsint](https://twitter.com/DailyOsint)
* [@OSINTIndustries](https://twitter.com/OSINTindustries)
* [@hackingarticles](https://twitter.com/hackinarticles)
* [@TrustedSec](https://twitter.com/TrustedSec)

and plenty of others.

## LinkedIn

Linked in is also a great place to follow people who have one and post a lot, like [John Hammond](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnhammond010/) or [TCM Sec](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tcm-security-inc/?miniCompanyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs\_miniCompany%3A35708983\&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad\_flagship3\_feed%3ByMRWVfx2SOKxiV6TT49zBA%3D%3D). Some of the other people/group/companies I follow are:

* [CyberSecurityHub](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-cyber-security-hub/?miniCompanyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs\_miniCompany%3A15222868\&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad\_flagship3\_feed%3ByMRWVfx2SOKxiV6TT49zBA%3D%3D)

* [SANS Digital Forensics and Incident Response](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/sans-digital-forensics-and-incident-response/)

and plenty more.
